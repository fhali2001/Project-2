# Crowdfunding ETL Mini Project

## Introduction
For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, you’ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

Since this is a one-week project, make sure that you have done at least half of your project before the third day of class to stay on track.

## Instructions
The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:

1. Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
2. Create the Campaign DataFrame
3. Create the Contacts DataFrame
4. Create the Crowdfunding Database

Refer to the provided starter code and files to help you get started.

## Files
Download the starter code and files [here](https://example.com).

## Before You Begin
1. Have one member of your group create a new repository, named Crowdfunding_ETL, for this project. Add your partner as a collaborator. Do not add this project to an existing repository.
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
3. Rename the `ETL_Mini_Project_starter_code.ipynb` file with the first name initial and last name of each member of the group, for example, `ETL_Mini_Project_NRomanoff_JSmith.ipynb`. Then, add this Jupyter notebook file and the Resources folder containing the `crowdfunding.xlsx` and the `contacts.xlsx` files to your repository.
4. Push the changes to GitHub.
5. Have your partner pull the changes, so both of you have the same notebook available on your computer.

## Requirements
The project will be evaluated against the requirements and assigned a grade according to the following table:

| Grade | Points |
|-------|--------|
| A (+/-) | 90+ |
| B (+/-) | 80–89 |
| C (+/-) | 70–79 |
| D (+/-) | 60–69 |
| F (+/-) | < 60 |

## Submission
You are required to submit the URL of your GitHub repository for grading.

**NOTE:** Projects are requirements for graduation. While you are allowed to miss up to two Challenge assignments and still earn your certificate, projects cannot be skipped.
